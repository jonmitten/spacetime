# Spacetime
A collection of tools for converting spaces and times. 

## Introduction
Different IoT devices use different units of measure and different standards for time, GPS coordinates, and sensor data. 
Spacetime aims to ease the implementation of both space (GPS coordinates) and time (timestamps from various input types).
